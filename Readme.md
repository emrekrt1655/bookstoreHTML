# Basic Bookstore App with mostly HTML CSS and partly vanilla JavaScript

In the project directory, you can open:

### `index.html` in your browser


Also you can reach from ###
Open [BookStore](###) to view it in your browser.

I aimed in this project to improve myself in pure HTML and CSS3 and partly JavaScript. This is a static Website. I have coded some functions to make different by adding or removing classes. I used a lot JavaScript toggle method.I tried to make with a basic UI Bookstore app. I used [Google Fonts ]("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@100;300;400;500;600&display=swap). And I used [Font Awesome Cdn](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css) for the icons. I also used [Swiper Cdn](https://swiperjs.com/get-started#use-swiper-from-cdn) for the slider.
